# Employee Data Analysis with SQL
University of Wisconsin Extension - Data Analytics and Visualization Certificate  
SQL Database Creation with Postgres, Module 9

## About
This project requires creating SQL databases with a large amount of older data stored within a company's database. Specifically, we are analyzing the employee data from 1980 - 1990 and pulling specific data points from different tables. There are 6 tables that hold all of the data related to previous employees. A schema was created for each table and then imported using Postgres. Finally, specific questions about the employee data were answered using queries, again in Postgres.

## Table of Contents
EmployeeSQL folder
  - SQL query to create the tables to hold data
  - SQL query to analyze the data and answer questions about the data
    
Data folder (CSV files that hold the original data)
  - departments
  - dept_ employee
  - dept_manager
  - employees
  - salaries
  - titles
    
ERD Employee SQL.png is a visual of the data in the form of an Entity Relationship Diagram

## Getting Started / Installation
For this probject, you need to install Postgres and utilize pgAdmin

## Analysis / Results
The SQL code written to create the six CSV's can be found in the "SQL query to create tables" file in the EmployeeSQL file.  
The data was analyzed for specific questions. The SQL code written for this can be visualized in the "SQL query for data analysis" file in the EmployeeSQL file. 
 
Here is an example of the syntax in the first question:

## Acknowledgments
Liang, lyam on Slack, helped me resolve FOREIGN KEY errors in my Table schema

I found an example from Josh Frankel on his blog to help get the right syntax for the question 8 aggregate functions and ORDER BY
